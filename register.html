          <h3>Enactment</h3>
          <p>If we travel down the memory lane, one of the most cherished moments would be the ones where we

          <h3>Character Face-off</h3>
          <p>What happens when two of your favourite
            fictional characters come alive and converse
            on topics of utmost interest? What happens
            when you are asked to step in their shoes and
            enact the arguments for them? Game Over -
            the character face-off competition
            anticipates such intriguing debates ranging
            from existentialism, accountability and
            desperation, stretching as far as the
            imagination goes. The event aims at a
            synaesthetic experience performed on stage,
            freed from the boundaries of virtuality and
            textuality.
            </p>
          <h5>Rules and Regulations:</h5>
          <p>
            1. Participants are required to pair up and make
            teams of two for the event and enact out debates
            concerning the allotted topics through the point of

            sets.<br>
            2. The allotted time slot for each team is 6 minutes.

            3. Participants can resort to English, Bengali or
            Hindi during the face-off. Switching between
            languages is also permitted.<br>
            4. Participants are encouraged to come up with
            original, interactive arguments which would reflect
            their sound knowledge of the chosen characters
            and the topic of concern- based on which they
            would be judged.<br>

            sequences from your favourite book at the back of your
            math notebook? What if years later you were told that
            the doodles you used to keep hidden

            life? The Presidency Literature Festival 1.0
